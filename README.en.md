> **Note:** QManager is the successor to [SimpleAdmin](https://github.com/dr-dolomite/simpleadmin-mockup), rebuilt from the ground up with a modern tech stack and improved user experience for managing Quectel modems like the RM520N-GL, RM551E-GL, and similar devices.

## Features

### Signal & Network Monitoring
- **Live Signal Dashboard** — Real-time RSRP, RSRQ, SINR with per-antenna values (4x4 MIMO) and 30-minute historical charts
- **Network Events** — Automatic detection of band changes, cell handoffs, carrier aggregation changes, and connectivity events
- **Latency Monitoring** — Real-time ping with 24-hour history, jitter, packet loss, and aggregated views (hourly/12h/daily)

- **Traffic Statistics** — Live throughput (Mbps) and cumulative data usage

### Cellular Configuration
- **Band Locking** — Select and lock specific LTE/NR bands for optimal performance
- **Tower Locking** — Lock to a specific cell tower by PCI, with automatic failover and scheduled changes
- **Frequency Locking** — Lock to exact EARFCN/ARFCN channels

## Quick Install

SSH into your OpenWRT device and run:

```sh
set -e
REPO="dr-dolomite/QManager"
API="https://api.github.com/repos/${REPO}/releases?per_page=20"

JSON=$(uclient-fetch -qO- "$API" 2>/dev/null || wget -qO- "$API" 2>/dev/null || curl -fsSL "$API")
TAG=$(printf '%s' "$JSON" \
  | tr -d '\n' \
  | sed 's/},{/}\
{/g' \
  | sed -n '/"prerelease":[[:space:]]*true/{s/.*"tag_name":[[:space:]]*"\([^"]*\)".*/\1/p;q}')

[ -n "$TAG" ] || { echo "Failed to resolve latest pre-release tag"; exit 1; }

BASE="https://github.com/${REPO}/releases/download/${TAG}"
cd /tmp
wget -O qmanager.tar.gz "$BASE/qmanager.tar.gz"
wget -O sha256sum.txt "$BASE/sha256sum.txt"
sha256sum -c sha256sum.txt
tar xzf qmanager.tar.gz
sh /tmp/qmanager_install/install.sh
```

One-liner convenience (same verified flow):

```sh
curl -fsSL -o /tmp/qmanager-installer.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dr-dolomite/QManager/development-home/qmanager-installer.sh && sh /tmp/qmanager-installer.sh
```

The one-liner wrapper still downloads the latest pre-release tarball, verifies `sha256sum.txt`, and then executes `install.sh`.

To pin a specific release instead of latest pre-release, set `TAG` manually (for example `TAG="v0.1.13"`) and skip the API lookup block.

### Upgrading

From v0.1.7+, go to **Monitoring → Software Update** and use the built-in update flow — download, verify, and install without SSH.

### Uninstalling

```sh
set -e
REPO="dr-dolomite/QManager"
API="https://api.github.com/repos/${REPO}/releases?per_page=20"

JSON=$(uclient-fetch -qO- "$API" 2>/dev/null || wget -qO- "$API" 2>/dev/null || curl -fsSL "$API")
TAG=$(printf '%s' "$JSON" \
  | tr -d '\n' \
  | sed 's/},{/}\
{/g' \
  | sed -n '/"prerelease":[[:space:]]*true/{s/.*"tag_name":[[:space:]]*"\([^"]*\)".*/\1/p;q}')

[ -n "$TAG" ] || { echo "Failed to resolve latest pre-release tag"; exit 1; }

BASE="https://github.com/${REPO}/releases/download/${TAG}"
cd /tmp
wget -O qmanager.tar.gz "$BASE/qmanager.tar.gz"
tar xzf qmanager.tar.gz
sh /tmp/qmanager_install/uninstall.sh
```

One-liner uninstall:

```sh
curl -fsSL -o /tmp/qmanager-installer.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dr-dolomite/QManager/development-home/qmanager-installer.sh && sh /tmp/qmanager-installer.sh --uninstall
```

Use `QMANAGER_TAG="v0.1.14" sh /tmp/qmanager-installer.sh` to pin a specific version with the one-liner wrapper.

## Prerequisites

- Compatible Quectel modem (RM520N-GL, RM551E-GL, RM500Q, etc.) with AT command support
- OpenWRT device with the modem connected
- **Required packages:** `jq`, `sms-tool`

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| **Frontend** | Next.js 16, React 19, TypeScript 5 |
| **Styling** | Tailwind CSS v4, OKLCH colors, Euclid Circular B + Manrope |
| **Components** | shadcn/ui (42+ components), Recharts, React Hook Form + Zod |
| **Backend** | POSIX shell scripts (OpenWRT/BusyBox), CGI endpoints |
| **Real-time** | WebSocket (bandwidth monitor via websocat) |
| **AT Commands** | `qcmd` wrapper for Quectel modem serial communication |
| **Package Manager** | Bun |

## Architecture

```
Browser ─── authFetch() ─── CGI Scripts ─── qcmd ─── Modem (AT commands)
                │                  │
                │          Shell Libraries (11)
                │
        reads /tmp/qmanager_status.json
                │
         qmanager_poller
       (tiered polling: 2s/10s/30s)
```

The frontend is a statically-exported Next.js app served from the device. The backend is POSIX shell scripts running on OpenWRT — CGI endpoints for API requests and long-running daemons for data collection.

**Key Data Flow:**

- **Poller daemon** queries the modem via AT commands every 2–30s (3 tiers) and writes a JSON cache file
- **CGI endpoints** (58 scripts) read the cache for GET requests, execute AT commands for POST requests
- **React hooks** (38 custom hooks) poll the CGI layer and provide loading/error/staleness states
- **WebSocket** provides real-time bandwidth data directly to the dashboard

See [full documentation](docs/README.md) for architecture details, API reference, and development guides.

## Development

### Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) (recommended) or Node.js 18+

### Getting Started

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/dr-dolomite/qmanager.git
cd qmanager

# Install dependencies
bun install

# Start development server (proxies API to modem at 192.168.224.1)
bun run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

### Production Build

```bash
# Static export to out/
bun run build

# Full package (frontend + backend tarball + checksum)
bun run package
```

The `package` script builds the frontend, bundles it with backend scripts into a tarball, and generates a SHA-256 checksum — ready for distribution via GitHub Releases.
